### Other Operating Systems

First, install these dependencies:

- `python3`
- `python3-pip`
- `python3-venv`

Then, create a virtual environment and install all requirements into it:

```bash
python3 -m venv env
. env/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Finally, you can launch *JupyterLab* by running the command below:

```bash
jupyter lab
```

Now you can refer to [*PythonLectures.ipynb*](/PythonLectures.ipynb).

**Note**: During development, if you have installed new dependencies, please freeze them into `requirements.txt` for future use:

```shell
pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
```
